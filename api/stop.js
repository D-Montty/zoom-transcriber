# ‚úÖ FIXED - New Recall.ai API Implementation

## **What Was Wrong:**
Recall.ai completely changed their API structure. The old `/bot/{id}/transcript/` endpoint is deprecated.

## **New API Flow:**

### **Old Way (Deprecated):**
```
GET /bot/{bot_id}/transcript/  ‚ùå Returns "legacy endpoint" error
```

### **New Way (Correct):**
```
1. GET /bot/{bot_id}  ‚Üí Get bot info
2. Extract: recordings[0].media_shortcuts.transcript.data.download_url
3. GET download_url  ‚Üí Get actual transcript
```

---

## **üîß Files That MUST Be Updated:**

### **1. api/transcript.js** ‚úÖ Updated
- Now fetches bot info first
- Extracts download URL from recordings
- Downloads and formats transcript

### **2. api/stop.js** ‚úÖ Updated
- Stops the bot (leave_call)
- Attempts to fetch transcript using new API
- Returns transcript if ready, or empty if processing

### **3. api/start.js** ‚úÖ Already correct
- No changes needed (already uses correct endpoint)

### **4. api/live.js** ‚úÖ No changes needed
- Works with in-memory cache

### **5. api/recall/transcript.js** ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs attention
- Webhooks are being received but `bot_id` is undefined
- Need to see the actual webhook payload structure

---

## **üöÄ Deploy These 2 Updated Files:**

**Priority files to update:**
1. ‚úÖ `api/transcript.js` (see artifact above)
2. ‚úÖ `api/stop.js` (see artifact above)

---

## **üìã After Deploying:**

### **Test and Check Logs For:**

#### ‚úÖ Good Signs:
```
[TRANSCRIPT] Bot state: done
[TRANSCRIPT] Recordings count: 1
[TRANSCRIPT] Download URL found, fetching transcript...
[TRANSCRIPT] Downloaded 15 transcript blocks
[TRANSCRIPT] Final transcript: 2453 chars
```

#### ‚ùå If you still see:
```
[TRANSCRIPT] API error (400): ["This is a legacy endpoint..."]
```
Then the file didn't deploy correctly.

---

## **‚ö†Ô∏è Webhook Issue Still Exists:**

Your logs show:
```
[WEBHOOK] No usable text in webhook. BotId: undefined
```

This means webhooks ARE being received, but we're not extracting the `bot_id` correctly from the payload.

### **To Debug Webhooks:**

After deploying the transcript fixes, let's focus on webhooks:

1. **Check if enhanced logging is working** - Look for:
   ```
   [WEBHOOK] ===== RAW WEBHOOK RECEIVED =====
   [WEBHOOK] Full payload: { ... }
   ```

2. **Share the full webhook payload** from logs so I can see the exact structure

3. **For now, the POST-CALL transcript should work** even if live webhooks don't

---

## **üí° Why This Will Work:**

The transcript fetching after stopping should now work because:
- We're using the correct `/bot/{bot_id}` endpoint (no trailing slash)
- We're following the new API flow: bot info ‚Üí extract URL ‚Üí download transcript
- This is the official Recall.ai API as documented

---

## **üéØ Next Steps:**

1. **Deploy the 2 updated files** (`transcript.js` and `stop.js`)
2. **Test a full recording cycle**:
   - Start bot
   - Talk for 30 seconds
   - Stop bot
   - Wait 30-60 seconds
   - Click "Refresh Transcript" button
3. **Check Vercel logs** for the new log messages
4. **Share results** so we can fix the webhook `bot_id` extraction next

The transcript should now work after the call ends! üéâ
